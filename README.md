We are a group of students from the New York and Boston areas who are enthusiastic about physical activities. We started PhysTech in 2024 because there was no hackathon avaialble at that time for presenting our projects.

Physical activity is any body movement that works your muscles and requires more energy than resting. Walking, running, dancing, swimming, yoga, and gardening are a few examples of physical activity. -->

PhysTech is a student-organized online hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes or gamifies physical activities - including sports, fitness excercises and recreational practices. 

PhysTech offers a platform for you to think of needs, wants and challenges as an athlete, coach, recreational player or fan and deliver creative solutions (hacks) with technology.
