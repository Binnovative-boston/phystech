# Physical Activity and Technology Hack Day (PhysTech)

We are a group of students from the New York and Boston areas who are enthusiastic about physical activities. We started PhysTech in 2024 because there was no hackathon avaialble at that time for presenting our projects.

PhysTech is a student-organized online hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes and promotes any physical activities - including sports, workouts, fitness exercises, casual hobbies/pastimes and recreational adventures. 

PhysTech welcomes any types of physical activities. Sports and physical training are in. Yoga, pilates, ballet? Of course. Swimming, kayaking, cycling, dancing, skateboarding, rock/mountain climbing, hiking, horseback riding? Sure. Fishing, bowling, paddleboarding, scuba diving, rafting, cheer leading, outdoor bird watching, gardening, kite flying, disk golf (frisbee), or cornhole? Why not! 

Not only athletes and recreational players/practitioners, but fans, coaches, referees/judges and analysts are also welcome. You would be a great participant for PhysTech as far as you love what you are doing. 

PhysTech offers a platform for you to address needs, wants and challenges in physical activities and produce creative solutions (hacks) with technology.
