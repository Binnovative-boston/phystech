Physical Activity and Technology Hack Day (PhysTech)
</h1>

We are a group of students from the New York and Boston areas who are enthusiastic about physical activities. We started PhysTech in 2024 because there was no hackathon available at that time for presenting our projects.

PhysTech is an online international hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes and promotes physical activities - including sports, workouts, fitness exercises, casual hobbies/pastimes and recreational adventures. 

PhysTech welcomes any types of physical activities. Sports and physical training are in. Yoga, pilates, ballet? Of course. Swimming, kayaking, cycling, dancing, skateboarding, rock/mountain climbing, hiking, horseback riding? Sure. Fishing, bowling, paddleboarding, scuba diving, rafting, cheer leading, outdoor bird watching, gardening, kite flying, disk golf (frisbee), or cornhole? Why not! 

Not only athletes and recreational players/practitioners, but fans, coaches, referees/judges and analysts are also welcome. 
<!--You would be a great participant in PhysTech as far as you love what you are doing.-->

PhysTech offers you a platform to address various needs, wants and challenges in physical activities and produce creative solutions (hacks) with technology.
