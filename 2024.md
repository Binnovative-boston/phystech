PhysTech is an online hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes and promotes any physical activities - including sports, workouts, fitness exercises, casual hobbies/pastimes and recreational adventures.

PhysTech welcomes any types of physical activities. Sports and physical training are in. Yoga, pilates, ballet? Of course. Swimming, kayaking, cycling, dancing, skateboarding, rock/mountain climbing, hiking, horseback riding? Sure. Fishing, bowling, paddleboarding, scuba diving, rafting, cheer leading, outdoor bird watching, gardening, kite flying, disk golf (frisbee), or cornhole? Why not!

Not only athletes and recreational players/practitioners, but fans, coaches, referees/judges and analysts are also welcome.

PhysTech offers you a platform to address various needs, wants and challenges in physical activities and produce creative solutions (hacks) with technology.

PhysTech welcomes anyone of all ages and all technical skills, from limited experience to advanced.

Entry is free.

## Expected Project Topics:

Expected project topics include, but are not limited to: 

- Analyzing professional sports

**Project Work:** PhysTech is a “flexible” online hackathon. You can work on your project anytime until the event starts at September 10.

Each participant/team is required to complete ALL of the following 3 retirements:

Submit your project to Depost by 12pm on June 29 (Sat), EST.

Register your project presentation by 12pm on June 29 (Sat), EST.

Give a project presentation online at June 30 (Sun), EST.

Note that the deadlines are firm. No extensions will be given. Failure to meet the above requirements will disqualify you (and your team) in award judging. 

A link for presentation registration will be shared in the PhysTech 2024 channel in Discord. To register your presentation, you will be asked to submit:

Your name and contact info

Your project presentation title

An abstract (short one-paragraph description) of your project

A publicly accessible link to your project placed on a cloud-based code repository (e.g. GitHub) or hosting service (e.g. Google Drive).

We will announce the schedule of project presentations (i.e. what time each presentation starts) by early morning of June 30 (Sun), EST. A Zoom link will be made available in the PhysTech 2024 channel in Discord. 

In our current plan, each presentation will spend 10 minutes in total, including approx. 3 minutes for QAs with judges and other participants.
