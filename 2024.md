You can submit a link to your project on Devpost; however, please make sure that the link references the actual outcome of your work. 

**Project presentation:** We will announce the schedule of project presentations (i.e. what time each presentation starts) by early morning of June 30 (Sun), EST. A Zoom link will be made available in the PhysTech 2024 channel of Discord.
