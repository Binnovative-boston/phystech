PhysTech is an online hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes and promotes any physical activities - including sports, workouts, fitness exercises, casual hobbies/pastimes and recreational adventures.

PhysTech welcomes any types of physical activities. Sports and physical training are in. Yoga, pilates, ballet? Of course. Swimming, kayaking, cycling, dancing, skateboarding, rock/mountain climbing, hiking, horseback riding? Sure. Fishing, bowling, paddleboarding, scuba diving, rafting, cheer leading, outdoor bird watching, gardening, kite flying, disk golf (frisbee), or cornhole? Why not!

Not only athletes and recreational players/practitioners, but fans, coaches, referees/judges and analysts are also welcome.

PhysTech offers you a platform to address various needs, wants and challenges in physical activities and produce creative solutions (hacks) with technology.

PhysTech welcomes anyone of all ages and all technical skills, from limited experience to advanced.

Entry is free.
