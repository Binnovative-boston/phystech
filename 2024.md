<a name="overview"></a>
PhysTech is an online hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes and promotes any physical activities - including sports, workouts, fitness exercises, casual hobbies/pastimes and recreational adventures.

PhysTech welcomes any types of physical activities. Sports and physical training are in. Yoga, pilates, ballet? Of course. Swimming, kayaking, cycling, dancing, skateboarding, rock/mountain climbing, hiking, or horseback riding? Sure. Fishing, bowling, paddleboarding, scuba diving, rafting, cheer leading, outdoor bird watching, gardening, kite flying, disk golf (frisbee), or cornhole? Why not!

Not only athletes and recreational players/practitioners, but fans, coaches, referees/judges and analysts are also welcome.

PhysTech offers you a platform to address various needs, wants and challenges in physical activities and produce creative solutions (hacks) with technology.

PhysTech welcomes anyone of all ages and all technical skills, from limited experience to advanced.

Entry is free.

## Expected Project Topics:

Expected project topics include, but are not limited to:

## Requirements:

**Project Work:** PhysTech is a “flexible” online hackathon. You can work on your project anytime until 12pm on June 29 (Sat), EST.

**Project Submission:** You are required to complete **ALL of the following 3 retirements:**

- Submit your project to [Depost](https://phystech-2024-20890.devpost.com/) by **12pm on June 29 (Sat), EST**.
- Register your project presentation by **12pm on June 29 (Sat), EST**.
- Give a project presentation online at **June 30 (Sun), EST**.

Note that the deadlines are firm. No extensions will be given. Failure to meet the above requirements will disqualify you (and your team) in award judging. 

A link for presentation registration will be shared in the PhysTech 2024 channel in Discord. To register your presentation, you will be asked to submit:

- Your name and contact info
- Your project presentation title
- An abstract (short one-paragraph description) of your project
- A publicly accessible link to your project placed on a cloud-based code repository (e.g. GitHub) or hosting service (e.g. Google Drive). We will verify the actual outcome of your work with this link in the afternoon of June 29. Please note that we will not schedule your presentation if we cannot verify your actual work. You can submit a link to your project on Devpost; however, please make sure that the link references the actual outcome of your work. 

We will announce the schedule of project presentations (i.e. what time each presentation starts) by early morning of June 30 (Sun), EST. A Zoom link will be made available in the PhysTech 2024 channel in Discord. 

**Project presentation:** In our current plan, you will have 10 minutes in total for your presentation, including approx. 3 minutes for QAs with judges and other participants. A Zoom link will be made available at the PhysTech 2024 channel in Discord.
