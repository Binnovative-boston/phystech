## Hackathon Overview:
<a name="overview"></a>
PhysTech is an online, student-led hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes and promotes physical activities - including sports, workouts, fitness exercises, casual hobbies, and recreational adventures.

All types of physical activities are welcome. Traditional sports and athletic training? Absolutely. Yoga, pilates, ballet? Of course. Swimming, kayaking, cycling, dancing, skateboarding, rock/mountain climbing, hiking, horseback riding? Definitely. Fishing, bowling, paddleboarding, scuba diving, rafting, cheer leading, outdoor bird watching, gardening, kite flying, disk golf (frisbee), or cornhole? Why not!

PhysTech is open not only to athletes and recreational participants, but also to fans, coaches, referees/judges, and analysts.

PhysTech offers you a platform to identify needs, wants and challenges in physical activities and develop creative, technology-driven solutions (hacks) to address them.

## Requirements:

**Project Submission:** You are required to complete **ALL of the following 3 requirements:**

- Submit your project to Devpost by **12pm on June 27 (Sat), EST**.
- Register your project presentation on a Google Forms page by **12pm on June 27 (Sat), EST**.
- Give a project presentation online on **June 28 (Sun), EST**.

The deadlines are firm. No extensions will be given. Failure to meet these requirements will disqualify you (and your team) in award judging.

- A summary of your project (short one-paragraph description)
- A publicly accessible link to your project placed on a cloud-based code repository (e.g. GitHub) or online storage (e.g. Google Drive). We will verify the actual outcome of your work with this link. Please note that **we will not schedule your presentation if we cannot verify your actual work**. You can submit a link to your Devpost project page; however, please make sure that your Devpost page references the actual outcome of your work. 

**Project presentation:** We will announce the schedule of project presentations (i.e. what time each presentation starts) by early morning of June 28 (Sun), EST. A Zoom link will be made available in the PhysTech channel of Discord.

In our current plan, we will kick off around 10am on June 28 (Sun), EST. However, we may adjust the start time based on the locations (time zones) of presentation speakers. 

You will have 10 minutes in total for your presentation, including approx. 3 minutes for Q&As with judges and other participants.
