## Hackathon Overview:
<a name="overview"></a>
PhysTech is an online international hackathon for anyone who does, watches, analyzes and promotes physical activities - including sports, workouts, fitness exercises, casual hobbies/pastimes and recreational adventures.

PhysTech welcomes any types of physical activities. Sports, physical training and exercise are in. Yoga, pilates, jogging, cycling and hiking? Of course.
